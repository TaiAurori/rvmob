# RVMob

**RVMob** is a mobile Revolt client made in React Native. 

**Please note that RVMob is currently in beta.** It is exclusive to Android and contains several bugs/incomplete features - use at your own discretion.

For development updates and other news, join [RVMob's support server](https://rvlt.gg/YW312HPF).

## Installing

If you want to install RVMob, simply go to [the releases tab](https://github.com/revoltchat/rvmob/releases) and download the latest version. We plan on publishing RVMob to app stores in the future.

Debug builds are also produced for every commit. These are unoptimised - they're much larger and noticeably slower than the release builds, but you can try out new features early. Also bear in mind that they are produced as Android App Bundles (AABs), not APKs - to install them, you'll have to convert the bundles using something like [`bundletool`](https://developer.android.com/tools/bundletool).

## Building

If you want to build RVMob, you'll need:
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (18+),
- [Yarn Classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com),
- JDK 17 ([Microsoft's build](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/java/openjdk/download) works well),
- the latest Android SDK (preferably via [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)'s SDK Manager), and 
- [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx).

Then run the following:

```sh
yarn install
npx rn-nodeify -e
npx react-native-asset
yarn android # for the android app
```

CLI commands:

| Command          | Description                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `yarn start`     | Starts Metro (the dev server).            |
| `yarn test`      | Tests to see if everything is working.    |
| `yarn android`   | Runs the Android app.                     |
| `yarn ios`       | Runs the iOS app (broken/requires a Mac). |
| `yarn lint`      | Checks the code syntax using ESLint.      |

For more information, see a list of `react-native`'s commands [here](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/commands.md). You can access them by running `yarn react-native`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter bugs, first check if you're able to [open Revolt in your browser](https://app.revolt.chat); also, check if you have any firewall settings that may block the Revolt API.

If you're still experiencing issues, and there aren't any open issues for the bug(s) you're facing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/revoltchat/rvmob/issues).
